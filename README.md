# MET_CS777 Team 6 Term Paper

This repository contains all the necessary files and resources for the METCS777 Term Project at Boston University. The project focuses on developing a system for bike rebalancing optimization using data analytics and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to tackle the common urban mobility problem of rebalancing bike-sharing systems. The project utilizes machine learning models to predict bike usage and applies optimization techniques to suggest optimal bike distributions across stations, ensuring availability and minimizing operational costs.
